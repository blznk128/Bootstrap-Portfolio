# Bootstrap-Portfolio

So this one was really tough for me but I am very happy how it turned out. My orignal design wasn't very good but after trying over and over again, I came to about
90 percent to where i wanted to be. The issue i was having was the container for all the info like the about me section for example.  I couldn't get the margins right
no matter what i tried, and then the footer was a absolute NIGHTMARE. Bootstrap doesn't really have footers per say, only footer I was able to find was the sticky footer, so it stayed attached the bottom of the screen , even if your scrolled up. I did have fun with it, wish I had more time to add more of me into it instead of lorem texts.  I did learn a lot about bootstrap although I have a long way to go to master it.
